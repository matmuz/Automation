# Automation

This is my first automation project which is based on Sii's example app (PrestaShop). The purpose of this project is to show a sample of my code using Java and Selenium - a testing framework in this case. Feel free to use it, but keep it mind that at this moment it is being constantly updated and developed (which includes fixes and refactoring).

To run tests (Java and Maven required!):

 From an IDE:

    1. Download the project
    2. Open the project
    3. Right click on testng.xml file and run
    4. Done!

 From CMD:

    1. Download the project
    2. Use CMD to navigate to project
    3. Run mvn clean test command
    4. Done!

Finally, to run test reports (Allure required!) use command allure serve <path_to_allure-reports_in_project>.

You can also use provided scripts to run tests, run reports and clean reports.
