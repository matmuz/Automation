# Automation

This is my first automation project which is based on Sii's example app (PrestaShop). The purpose of this project is to show a sample of my code using Java and Selenium - a testing framework in this case. Feel fre to use it, but keep it mind that at this moment it is being constantly updated and developed (which includes fixes and refactoring).

To run the tests (from IDE):
1. Download the project
2. Open the project
3. Run testng.xml file
4. Done!

To run the tests (from CMD):
1. Download the project
2. Use CMD to navigate to project
3. Run mvn clean test command
4. Done!

To run test reports (using Allure - have to be installed locally) use command allure serve <path_to_allure-reports_in_project>
